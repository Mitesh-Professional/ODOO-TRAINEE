# Operators

* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators
* Bitwise Operators


## Arithmetic Operators:-
* These operators work with numeric values and perform common mathematical operations


* Addition (+): Adds two values together.
* Subtraction (-): Finds the difference between two values.
* Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
* Division (/): Divides one value by another.
* Modulus (%): Gives the remainder after division.
* Exponentiation (**): Raises a value to a power.
* Floor Division (//): Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer.

## Assignment Operators:-

* These assign values to variables:
* =: Assigns a value to a variable.
* +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.: Combine an operation with assignment (e.g., x += 3 is equivalent to x = x + 3).


## Comparison Operators:-
* Used to compare two values:
* Equal (==), Not Equal (!=), Greater Than (>), Less Than (<), Greater Than or Equal To (>=), Less Than or Equal To (<=)

## Logical Operators:-
* Combine conditional statements:
* and: Returns True if both statements are true.
* or: Returns True if at least one statement is true.
* not: Reverses the result.

## Identity Operators:-
* Compare objects based on memory location:
* is: Returns True if both variables refer to the same object.
* is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object.

## Membership Operators:-
* Test if a sequence is present in an object:
* in: Returns True if a value is in the object.
* not in: Returns True if a value is not in the object.

## Bitwise Operators:-
* Used for binary number comparison:
* & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << (Left Shift), >> (Right Shift)
