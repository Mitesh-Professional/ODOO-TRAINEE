# Comprehensions:- 
* Comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create new sequences (such as lists, dictionaries, and sets) from existing iterables. They allow you to apply operations to each element in an iterable and include the results in a new sequence1. There are four types of comprehensions in Python:

* List Comprehensions: These provide an elegant way to create new lists. The basic structure is:
* output_list = [output_exp for var in input_list if (var satisfies this condition)]
* You can use list comprehensions to generate new lists based on existing ones, filtering elements or applying transformations1.
* Dictionary Comprehensions: Similar to list comprehensions, but for dictionaries. They allow you to create dictionaries by specifying key-value pairs based on existing sequences1.
* Set Comprehensions: These create new sets using a similar syntax to list comprehensions. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements1
* Generator Comprehensions: These produce generator objects, which are memory-efficient and lazy-evaluated. They use parentheses instead of square brackets
