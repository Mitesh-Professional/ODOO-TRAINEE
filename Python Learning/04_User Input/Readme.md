# User Input
## you can obtain user input using the input() function. Hereâ€™s how it works:-

* In Python 3.6 and later versions, you use the input() method to prompt the user for input. It displays a message (prompt) to the user and waits for them to type a response. The input is returned as a string.
* Prompting user for input and storing it in a variable


* Code :-
* userInput = input("Enter anything: ")
* Printing the user's input
* print(userInput)


* Output :-
* Enter anything: print this
* print this
