# Collections:-
* list
* tuple
* dictionary
* collections module

# List:- 
* Lists are dynamic-sized arrays that can hold elements of different data types.
* They allow duplicates and are declared using square brackets ([]).
* Common use cases:
* Storing a collection of items (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).
* Manipulating data (e.g., adding, removing, sorting).
* Representing arrays in JSON format.
* Example:-
* my_list = [1, 2, 'apple', True]
* Output:-
* [1, 2, 'apple', True]

## Tuple:-
* Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
* They are declared using parentheses (()).
* Common use cases:
* Representing fixed data (e.g., coordinates, RGB values).
* Inserting records in databases through SQL queries.
* Parentheses checker (e.g., validating balanced parentheses).
* Example:-
* my_tuple = (10, 20, 'banana')
* Output:-
* (10, 20, 'banana')

## Dictionary:-
* Dictionaries store key-value pairs and are unordered (since Python 3.7).
* They use curly braces ({}) and are useful for mapping data.
* Common use cases:
* Creating data frames with lists.
* Representing JSON data.
* Efficient lookups by key.
* Example:-
* my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'Wonderland'}
* Output:-
* {'name':'Alice',
*  'age' :'30',
*  'city':'Wonderland'
* }

## Next Is Methods 
* list methods
* tuple methods

## List Methods:- 

* append(): Adds an element to the end of a list.
* clear(): Removes all elements from a list.
* copy(): Creates a copy of the list.
* count(): Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the list.
* extend(): Appends elements from another iterable (e.g., another list) to the current list.
* index(): Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.
* insert(): Inserts an element at a specific position in the list.
* pop(): Removes and returns the element at a given position.
* remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
* reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the list.
* sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
* Check list_methods File. All Methods Example are done in This File.

## Tuple Methods:-
* count(): Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple.
* index(): Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position where it was found 
* len(): Returns the number of elements in the tuple.
* max(): Returns the maximum value in a tuple (only works for tuples of comparable elements).
* min(): Returns the minimum value in a tuple (also works for comparable elements).
* sorted(): Returns a new sorted list from the elements of the tuple.
* sum(): Calculates the sum of all elements in the tuple (if they are numeric).
