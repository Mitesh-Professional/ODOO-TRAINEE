# Dictionaries:-
* A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({}). Each key maps to its associated value
* As of Python 3.7, dictionaries are ordered, meaning that the items have a defined order that won’t change.
* In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered, so you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
* Regardless of version, dictionary items are presented in key-value pairs

# Creating a Dictionary:
* dic_item = {'name': 'mitesh'}
* print(dic_item)

# Dictionary Methods:-

* clear(): Removes all elements from the dictionary.
* copy(): Returns a copy of the dictionary.
* fromkeys(): Creates a new dictionary with specified keys and a default value.
* get(key): Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
* items(): Returns a list of tuples, each containing a key-value pair.
* keys(): Returns a list of all keys in the dictionary.
* pop(key): Removes the element with the specified key.
* popitem(): Removes the last inserted key-value pair.
* setdefault(key, default_value): Returns the value of the specified key. If the key doesn’t exist, it inserts the key with the provided default value.
* update(other_dict): Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary.
* values(): Returns a list of all values in the dictionary.
