# Loop:-
* For Loop
* While Loop
* Nested Loop

## For Loop:-
* Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
* Example: Printing each fruit in a list:
* fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
* for x in fruits:
*    print(x)
* Output:-
* apple
* banana
* cherry

## While Loop:-
* Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
* Example: Printing numbers from 0 to 5:
* num = 0
* while num < 6:
*    print(num)
*    num += 1
* Output:-
* 0
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5

# Nested Loop:- 
* Combining loops within loops.
* Example: Printing a multiplication table:
* output:-
* 1	2	3	4	5	
* 2	4	6	8	10	
* 3	6	9	12	15	
* 4	8	12	16	20	
* 5	10	15	20	25
