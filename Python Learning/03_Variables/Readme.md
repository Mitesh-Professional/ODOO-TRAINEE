## Creating Variables
* Python doesn’t require explicit variable declaration. A variable is created when you assign a value to it.
Example:
* value = 5
* name = "Mitesh Amin"

## Data Types and Casting:
* Variables don’t need a specific type declaration. They can change type after being set.
* You can specify data types using casting
* x = str(3)    # x is a string ('3')
* y = int(3)    # y is an integer (3)
* z = float(3)  # z is a float (3.0)
## Getting Variable Type
* Use the type() function to determine a variable’s data type:
* x = 5
* print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
## Quotes for Strings
* String variables can be declared using single or double quotes
* name = "John"  # Same as name = 'John'
## Case Sensitivity
* Variable names are case-sensitive:
* a = 4
* A = "Sally"  # A won't overwrite a
