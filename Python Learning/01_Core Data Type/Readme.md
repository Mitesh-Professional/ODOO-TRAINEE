# Topic is a Core Data Type

## here is 10 Core Data Type:- 

    - Integer
    - Float
    - Bool
    - String
    - List
    - Tuple
    - Sets
    - Dictionaries
    - Byte
    - None
## Integer:-

* Python uses a fixed-size representation for integers.
* The size depends on the platform (32-bit or 64-bit).
* Positive integers are stored directly as binary values.
* Negative integers use twoâ€™s complement representation.
* Example: 42 is stored as 101010 (assuming 6 bits).

## Float
* Python uses IEEE 754 double-precision format (64 bits).
* Sign bit (1 bit), exponent (11 bits), and fraction (52 bits).
* Example: 3.14 is stored as 01000000000010010001111010111000010100011110101110000101.
## Bool
* Stored as integers (0 for False, 1 for True).
* Example: True is stored as 1.
## String
* Strings are sequences of Unicode characters.
* Each character occupies 1 to 4 bytes (UTF-8 encoding).
* Example: "Hello" is stored as H + e + l + l + o .
## List 
* Lists are dynamic arrays of references to objects.
* The list itself stores pointers to elements.
* Elements can be of different types.
* Example: [1, 2, 3] stores references to the integers 1, 2, and 3.
## Tuple
* Similar to lists but immutable.
* Tuples store references to elements.
* Example: ("apple", "banana") stores references to the strings.
## Sets

## Dictionaries
* Dictionaries use hash tables.
* Keys are hashed to find their position in memory.
* Values are stored alongside the keys.
* Example: {"name": "John", "age": 30} maps keys to values.
## Byte
* Used for binary data (e.g., image files).
* Immutable sequence of bytes.
* Example: b'\x00\x01\x02' represents binary data.
## None
* Represents absence of a value.
* Stored as a singleton object.
* Example: None is a unique reference.
